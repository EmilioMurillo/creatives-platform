This is a Ruby on Rails app that would allow different artist to collaborate and explore each others ideas. Ultimitley this platform would a private gallery for a small group of friends.

# Instructions to run

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails

I wanted to get familiar with Ruby on Rails and the MVC framework. I read the docs and was able to understand how a simple CRUD app works. Most of what comes with the docs is very simple and boring. I had a tough time understanding how everything really connects and works. At the end of the day I got things to work perfectly.

## Optimizations

After being able to make things work finally. I wanted to add a whole welcome page that would take me to the "articles"(articles would be 'creations' or 'post')page. The initial page was the design I was going for which would be the minimalistic feel. Then figure out a way to be able to add video and images to CRUD methods. Yes.
